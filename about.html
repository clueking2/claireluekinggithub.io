		<h2> <u>My Philosophy</u> </h2>
			<h3> Be Authentic </h3>
			<div class="value-section">	
				<p> Authenticity is essential in every aspect of design.</p>
				<p> This principle guides the decision-making process at each stage, ensuring that design choices align with values and vision. </p>
				<p>Not every design will resonate with everyone, so it is crucial to stay focused on what truly matters, being genuine. </p>
			</div>	
			
			<h3> Be Curious </h3>
			<div class="value-section">	
				<p> Curiosity is a key asset.</p>
				<p> It fosters creative thinking when approaching problems and seeking solutions. </p>
				<p>This helps to enable the exploration of a broader range of possibilities to effectively address design challenges.</p>
			</div>

			<h3> Be Respectful </h3>
			<div class="value-section">
				<p> Respect is non-negotiable.</p> 
				<p> Actively listening to others is crucial for fostering collaboration and allowing ideas to grow. </p>
				<p>Without respect, trust cannot be established and kept between users and designers.</p>
