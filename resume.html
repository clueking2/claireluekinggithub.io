            <h3>UltraInsight: Analyzing Paces, Ages, and Trends in Ultramarathon Finishers</h3>
            <p>This project aims to answer four questions related to ultramarathon racing and training. Through data analysis these questions are answered and there are even some additional information gained secondary to the questions answered. I created this project as a semester project for my Data Mining course in the Applied Computer Science program at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>
